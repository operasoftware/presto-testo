<!-- Purpose: To test the REV attribute of the LINK element. The REV attribute defines the relationship of this document to the referenced document in the opposite direction of what the REL attribute does -->

<!-- Expected result: There is no actual result. Rather, the REV attribute value identifies the relationship of this current document to the referenced document -->
