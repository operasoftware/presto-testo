<!-- Purpose: To test the ALT attribute with the IMG element. This page supplies three ALT tests: one with the preference option "automatically load images" selected,  











and one with the preference option "automatically load images" deselected (using the first image on the page)











and a third test (using the bottom image on the page) to confirm that the alt text is properly displayed for a broken image link.-->

<!-- Expected result: IMAGES AUTOMATICALLY LOADED: Image should be displayed. If you mouse over the image, the alt name "eggplant" should be revealed. 











IMAGES NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOADED: A place holder icon should appear in place of the image. If you mouse over the icon, the alt name "eggplant" should be revealed.-->
