<!-- Purpose:To check the BR tag. If the normal BR tag is used, text will keep filling in next to a displayed image.  In order to stop filling in next to the image you must issue an expanded BR tag.  







Such as BR clear=left.The expanded BR tag will drop the text to the base of the image and begin rendering.--><!-- Expected result: Using Clear = left ,the second paragraph of text should render below the image.-->

<title>XHTML Functional -- BR - CLEAR=left</title>

</head>

<body>

<img src="images/image.gif" align="left" alt="image" />With floating images

(refer to image alignment) the (break) BR tag has to be expanded.

If you wish to stop filling the space next to an aligned image and

start on the next line underneath the image, then a normal line

break will not work - it will just break the line to the current

margin alongside the image. A new paragraph will also continue

wrapping the text alongside the image. <br clear="left" />

 However, this sentence should be rendered below the image since it

follows a BR tag that has CLEAR=LEFT assigned.
