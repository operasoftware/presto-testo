<!-- Purpose: To check text flow around floating images using the expanded <BR> tag.-->

<!-- Expected result:  The sentence after the <br clear='none'> should begin on the first



             line below the images.-->

<title>HTML Functional -- BR - CLEAR=none</title>

</head>

<body>

<img src="images/image.gif" align="left" alt="image" /> <img

src="images/image.gif" align="right" alt="image" />With floating images (refer

to image alignment) the (break) BR tag has to be expanded. If you

wish to stop filling the space next to an aligned image and start

on the next line underneath the image, then a normal line break

will not work - it will just break the line to the current margin

alongside the image. A new paragraph will also continue wrapping

the text alongside the image. <br clear="none" />

 In particular, this sentence should be rendered beginning on the

next line with the current margin alongside the image since it

follows a BR tag that has CLEAR=none assigned.
